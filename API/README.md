# Backend API
This API will act as a shim between the apps running on individual user's computers and the public (free or paid) APIs I will be using for gathering information as well as some of its own fuctions at some point.  

### Backend APIs Used
* List TBD

### Usage
This API will eventually be running on a public facing server, so anyone will be able to use it as long as they agree to the Terms of Service. This will be availaible once it is deployed into a production mode.
